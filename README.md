# Simple Task List
A coding assignment by HiTower IT for Frontend Developer position using Vue.js 2 framework.

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

```

## Instruction Given

1. Create a task, which will be added to the list.
2. Remove tasks.
3. Markt tasks as being completed.
4. Add pagination when more than 5 tasks are created.

```bash
The tasks don't have to be stored within a database and can get lost on a page refresh.
```

## Extra notes
1. A simple validation is implemented using vee-validate.
2. Nuxt.js is used instead of native Vue.js due to relative familiarity among both.
3. Only minimal styling concept is applied (focused more on functionality).
